Okay, all the interviews have a structure
First of all, you have to introduce yourself here
You can answer it like my name is Victor Koistuk
Originally I'm from Republic of Moldova but I hold you european passport because I'm feeling that my mentality is more european than post soviet as in my country
I am wondering to progress, to grow and to find out more opportunities in UK
That's why I am here hearing of this post with your support
I have a big family, very kind wife, a very supporting wife and two sons, two kids
I I'd love to spend my free time in fishing because this process give me my intimate space, my mind brainstorming, my own brainstorming in my mind so I can discover myself in fishing as introvert because I'm feeling too comfortable in my work as a developer because here I can express my introvertical part in creation, in creation and developing of new products and new logics, new functionality and functionality
That's why phishing is the best way to maintain this thinking process, to restart my brain, to restart my brain all the time
And like twice per month I organize my time to feel free in this process
Other activities I love to spend my free time with my family, with my sons, to give them the culture of growth, of developing and with my friends
I enjoy table tennis, small venues, sometimes.
